<p>Hello! My name is Devin Nicholson and I'm a recent Cal Poly SLO graduate with a degree in Software Engineering. I'm currently 23 years old and working as a Performance Engineer at MarkLogic after 2 amazing summers as an intern there. Although I work in the peninsula, I live in San Francisco, and absolutely adore it. I'm a Chicago native, so cities have always felt like home to me. </p>

<p>I have a lot of random hobbies and passions. For one, I'm a huge gamer and always have been. After many years of playing WoW, I've decided to focus on the many other games out there! I'm going to start streaming on Twitch again soon so I'll be sure to send updates on that. Other than nerding out with programming and gaming, I love to workout-- mostly Pilates, Barre and Yoga. I also enjoy hiking, skiing, water sports, and pretty much anything that involves a board. In the near future, I'll be traveling to more places, but as of right now I've been to Thailand, Bali and Australia. Feel free to ask me questions about anything!</p>
