## Lost Coast Surf Tech
Lost Coast Surf Tech is a company that is revolutionizing surfing by creating the world's first tech surfboard fin. When I first joined LCST, they were simply pitching an idea that had yet come to life. They were in search of Software Engineers to create their app and work on connecting the app to their fin via bluetooth. And this is how LCST fell into my lap as my senior project. LCST has taught me how dynamic it is to work in a startup environment. Design was always changing as new ideas flowed. There were a lot of frustrating moments, but I wouldn't have had it any other way. Working with LCST as my senior project not only resulted in an amazing prototype, but also a lifelong connection with an amazing group of innovators.

### Senior Project Work
When I was a developer for LCST, I worked on their iOS application on the backend. There were 3 iOS developers on the team at the time; a computer engineer working on the bluetooth connection, an AMAZING designer (both graphically and programmatically), and myself on the backend. Other than working on the database, I worked a lot with the designer to figure out the best ways to display the data from the numerous different APIs that I was pulling data from. I was able to learn a lot about working with entrepreneurs and other programmers at the same time in order to work toward an end goal.
