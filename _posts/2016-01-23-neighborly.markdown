## Neighborly
Neighborly was the product of Camp Polyhacks 2018, a hackathon based on teaming up to come up with ideas to change the world around us, targeting social issues specifically. Instead of the typical hackathon where programmers sit down with headphones on and program for 48 hours straight, Camp Polyhacks requires each team of 8 to have various people experienced in business, programming, and design. 

### What is Neighborly?
The fires across California have been devastating, leaving people feeling completely helpless. Neighborly was created to assist the affected people. Essentially, Neighborly allows users to take pictures of their home, using Google Vision to automatically detect each item and store the item and their price into a database. If something were to happen to your home, there is documentation to send to insurance.

### What prompts users to take action before a fire?
In order for users to want to use this app before something happens to their home, we created a whole different aspect to the app. Users can document their items in their home for many reasons, but we decided that users might want to use this for social good. The fires have left many people with nothing. People's items link up with the items that charities need. If a needed item matches to someone's item, they receive a notification that their item would be a helpful donation. It also allows people to efficiently donate items, giving them an idea of what they don't need anymore, and a map of the nearest charity.
